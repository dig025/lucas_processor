We were able to get program 1 to work perfectly on the ISA/architecture that we
designed (64/64). While we implemented program 2 and 3 in C code, we struggled
to find the time to translate the C code to assembly after we were able to get 
program 1 working since our priority was getting 1 program running. In our 
architecture, we were able to get all our instructions to work properly through 
our data path. Every unit of our architecture works as well. There is also a 
detailed writeup on the instruction design in the README.md file.
